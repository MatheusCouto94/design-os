# Product Roadmap

## Sections

### 1. Foundation & Setup
Helps users define their product vision, understand their target audience, and establish the foundational design thinking before diving into specifics.

### 2. Design System
Creates the core visual language: design tokens (colors, spacing, typography), component styles, and consistency rules that will be applied across all screens.

### 3. Screen Design & Audit
The main workspace for analyzing, critiquing, and improving individual UI screens with AI-powered feedback on hierarchy, layout, and UX decisions.

### 4. UX Writing & Content
Focuses on improving clarity, microcopy, error messages, and overall content strategy to make the product easier to understand and use.

### 5. Export & Handoff
Packages all design decisions, tokens, and specifications into formats that can be implemented directly in code or handed off to AI coding assistants.
