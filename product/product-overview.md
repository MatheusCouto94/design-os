# Design OS

## Description
Design OS is a design-thinking system that helps developers and founders build better products without needing to be designers. It combines conversational AI guidance with structured workflows to teach design principles while providing actionable, code-ready specifications for visual hierarchy, layout, typography, and UX decisions.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Developers lack design knowledge and don't know what good design looks like
Design OS provides structured prompts, examples, and education on visual hierarchy, spacing, typography, and UX principles through conversational guidance.

### Problem 2: There's no systematic process to apply design thinking consistently
Guided workflows walk users through key design decisions step-by-step: defining product vision, auditing screens, creating design systems, and improving UX writing.

### Problem 3: Products have inconsistent design systems and visual language
Design OS helps create and document design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) and maintains consistency across the product.

### Problem 4: There's a gap between design insight and implementation
Outputs are code-ready: CSS values, layout specifications, design tokens, and written documentation that can be directly applied or handed off to coding assistants.

### Problem 5: Products feel amateur due to poor visual hierarchy and unclear UX
Provides critique and analysis of existing screens with specific, actionable improvements and clear reasoning behind each recommendation.
